	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Masters of Doom&rdquo; was written by David Kushner in the course of six years. In these six years, he conducted hundreds of interviews [1], attended various Doom and Quake tournaments, and launched a Hydrogen Peroxide powered rocket with John Carmack [2]. The result was beyond belief. The book reached completion in 2003 and was published by Random House. &ldquo;Masters of Doom&rdquo; chronicles the tales of the &ldquo;Two Johns&rdquo;, John Romero and John Carmack, their company id Software, and their eventual dispersion.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Kushner adopts a novel-like narrative throughout the book and begins by introducing the two main characters: the &ldquo;Two Johns.&rdquo; John Romero was born in Colorado Springs in 1967 [3]. His father quickly left the family, however, and he was mainly raised by his stepfather, John Schuneman. Schuneman was a former drill sergeant and held one immutable belief: &ldquo;No video games.&rdquo; Romero didn&rsquo;t heed the warning, however. He continued his escapades to the arcade relentlessly [4]. As time passed, Romero grew more and more in love with video games. He acquired an Apple II and quickly learned how to create programs [5]. He also expressed his rebellious side: hooking up with numerous girlfriends and creating carnage-filled comics.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Roeland Park, Kansas, John Carmack was growing as well. John Carmack was born into an upper-class family, his father being a famous news anchor and his mother being an esteemed scientist [6]. His earlier years were filled with constant study. His efforts paid off, as he was placed in a 9th grade proficiency level when he was only seven [7]. His life took a turn when he was introduced to the field of computing. Carmack quickly found solace in creating and playing games. He was caught breaking into the school&rsquo;s lab one night and then sent to juvy [8]. When he returned, he was hardened and burning to hack.</p>

<p>Eventually, the two met at Softdisk, where they established the Gaming department [9]. Along with new friends and old companions, they founded id Software. At id Software, they would create legends for years to come: Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement, Commander Keen, Doom, and Quake [10]. With every release, they broke the industry. This group of skinny twenty-somethings were on the rise to fame and riches.</p>

<p>With the release of Quake, however, problems began to surface. Romero was becoming distracted. With gamers bowing down to Romero and exclaiming &ldquo;We are not worthy. We are not worthy,&rdquo; Romero lost focus in creating games and became more interested in playing them [11]. Eventually, Carmack was forced to fire Romero, leaving him to create his own company Ion Storm [12]. The motto of Ion Storm was &ldquo;Design is Law&rdquo;, the idea that technology should support design, rather than the other way around [13]. Ion Storm&rsquo;s office was as great as its motto. A penthouse furnished with balloons, Las Vegas slot machines, Sledgehammers, and games abound [14]. However, Ion Storm eventually collapsed due to its lack of proper management.</p>

<p>Carmack continued to lead id Software to success. He released Quake 3 with his new and improved graphics engine and continued to do so. His final work at id Software was Rage, which also achieved widespread critical acclaim [15]. After completing Rage, Carmack and id Software had a graceful descent. As of now, Carmack is the Chief Technological Officer of Oculus VR [16].</p>

<h3>Impressions</h3>

<p>I was constantly impressed by &ldquo;Masters of Doom.&rdquo; With each chapter, I found myself inspired and wishing to read more. Rather than a history book, &ldquo;Masters of Doom&rdquo; was closer to a Greek epic. I sympathized with both the main characters. I felt anxious when id Software was being sued. I felt triumphant when they succeeded.</p>

<p>To be frank, I was expecting a rather drab piece. Yet, I was simply blown away by the quality of the book as well  as its story. David Kushner&rsquo;s writing style is quite unique. Compared to most non-fiction works, he employed the third-person narrative quite frequently. There was a sense of action, similar to those in Blockbuster movies, throughout the entire piece.</p>

<p>His phrasing is curious as well. It is casual, frequently using disparaging terms. Kushner doesn&rsquo;t shy away from the darker corners of Hacker Culture. Yet, he takes care to explain each concept thoroughly, which might be confusing for most readers. In this way, he maintains the unique style of the book while appealing to a broader audience.</p>

<p>The purpose of &ldquo;Masters of Doom&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t to enlighten its readers in the field of Game History. It is to shed light on the complex dynamics of id Software and the stories behind its leading two egos. Rather than appealing to only video game enthusiasts, &ldquo;Masters of Doom&rdquo; is a fascinating tale for anyone to read. The book does appeal to gamers foremost, however. It&rsquo;s unlikely that an average reader, without knowing what Doom or who John Carmack is, would pick up this book off the shelf. John Romero and John Carmack are giants in the field of video games, but little known else where.</p>

<p>In contrast to most game history texts, the book is more focused on the creators rather than the games themselves. Although &ldquo;Masters of Doom&rdquo; goes into detail regarding the creation of the games themselves, it&rsquo;s clear that the true focus of the book was the &ldquo;Two Johns.&rdquo; I find this to be a welcome surprise, however. The story behind id  Software is truly intriguing and I&rsquo;m glad that Kushner decided to write this piece. I think David Kushner held little motive other than pure interest when writing the book. It&rsquo;s not easy to work continuously on a book, interviewing hundreds and compiling notes. Furthermore, Random House tends to be lenient towards content and we can see that in &ldquo;Masters of Doom.&rdquo; A more traditional publisher might have chosen to censor some portions of the book, yet they are there quite clearly in &ldquo;Masters of Doom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Personally, I learned much from &ldquo;Masters of Doom&rdquo; about video games, business, and friendship. I&rsquo;ve always wondered what the key to success was. Was Bill Gates and Steve Jobs more talented than I was, or were they simply lucky? The question harassed me daily. Yet, I think I found the answer: to simply work. There&rsquo;s little to be gained by wondering about the future ahead of me. Rather than do so, I wish to look at the world in front of me and live. As Carmack said, &ldquo;If you want to set off and go develop some grand new thing, you don&rsquo;t need millions of dollars of capitalization. You need enough pizza and Diet Coke to stick in your refrigerator, a cheap PC to work on, and the dedication to go through with it. We slept on floors. We waded across rivers.&rdquo;</p>
