I’ve been doing very little as of yet.

Writing little, reading less, and making few attempts to edify myself. \
I wake aimless, set about the day with some presupposed meander, and end it early.

It’s familiar yet odd. \
Listlessness and lethargy are frequent guests in this house of mine. \
But the companions who typically follow suit are missing: dread and guilt.

<br>

A fear of freedom exists. \
As strange as it is, I seem to like being told what to do.

Career is the prototypal example.

An engineer, a writer, a climber. \
One builds, one writes, and another climbs. \
Therein these words, I am so defined.

<br>

“What do you do for work?” \
I struggle to answer.

Unemployment is looked upon with envy or disdain. \
A creative pursuit is fetishized or reduced to a whim. \
A break is the most accepted, a tacit understanding that I too, will return to pay my societal dues.

<br>

So what have I been doing? \
Nothing. 

A sense of peace envelops me. \
Clouds of uncertainty cease to loom, unveiling serenity and silence in its stead.

I seem to be okay doing nothing. \
I seem to be okay staying still.

I don’t feel like dying. \
I just feel like living.
