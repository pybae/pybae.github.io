The above is my current training plan, written and started as of November 25th.

It is based off an amalgamation of past experiences and experiments as well as a large pool of borrowed knowledge from others.

I'm self-taught in both climbing and training. And though I've learned a few things now, there always remains much to learn.

This is a bit of a commentary on how to approach training and why.

<br>

The first question worth asking is "should I train."

The answer is personal and is often no. And it should be!`

Progression is only one part of climbing. \
Actively pursuing it, especially with the short-term mindset to "get stronger" often only ends in injury and disappointment. Just climbing and enjoying the sport will typically reward you regardless - there is no need to actively and consciously train to progress.

Most people find training hard and boring. \
Though training itself need not be boring (and can be more than just endless hangs and pull ups), the mindset you need to adopt to train properly is exhausting. It requires you to confront your fears, your weaknesses and impose willful restraints on your climbing. That can directly take away from your enjoyment in climbing: whether that's social climbing with friends or enjoying your specialized niche.

So why train? \
My own answer is pretty simple: because I like it. I like the process: focusing on acquisition of skill and technique, targeting meaningful gains in strength, and practicing performing. \
I'm a weirdo that likes training for training's sake. And I love climbing. I get inspired and motivated by big goals and dream climbs. Working towards that is a source of fulfillment and fun.

I'm curious to know yours.

<br>


Now, we can get into the meat of it: "How to train."

The answer depends on the specifics of your answer to the above "why?" It's useful to frame the conversation in the context of goals. Goals that should be a little more concrete than "Send V grade" and "Get stronger." Goals that reflect you and your reasons to climb.

My own goals are all outdoors and local to the Northeast. They are concrete in the form of specific boulders but also in schools of technique I'd like to progress in. \
That leads to working backwards: how do I train for climb _X_? how do I train in _Y_ style?

Typically the more specific the better. But it is a danger to overspecify as well, unless you are quite confident that this is the one climb, the one style you derive the most joy in.

<br>

Now it's time to geek out.

I think of climbing as consisting of two components: physical and mental. Both are to be trained.

The physical aspects are what's most typically associated with training.  Hangboarding, pull ups, campus boarding, board climbing, weight-lifting, the list goes on and on. And climbing! \
Though these things are all helpful, and I do much of it myself, it's best to take an intentioned approach to each of them.

I will caveat this by also saying you should generally do what you like doing. \
If you like hangboarding, if squatting gives you joy, if bench press is an act of therapy, by all means keep doing so. It's a tempting trap to fall into over-optimizing one's training plan when there really is no need to.

So what does an intentioned approach look like?

Well, for each of these exercises, ask yourself, why am I doing them? And what do I hope to address by doing them? \
Climbing itself is included in this process, though it's typically a good and safe default.

Just climb is an oft prescribed mantra - and generally sane as well - but it's one to analyze. \
Do you climb with a big group and try whatever the squad does? Do you climb alone? Do you gravitate to your style? Do you actively climb your anti-style? Do you like projecting or do you like flashing? Do you climb on wood, on plastic, on rock?

We need to be consciously aware of our own habits and think about what "just climb" means for ourselves.

For me, if I "just climb", I'll typically project and choose something that suits me: typically crimpy, techy, and committing. Ideally on rock, rarely indoors.

<br>

So why train the physical at all?

One can never be strong enough - a true enough statement, but it also serves to be actively self-critical and nuanced when it comes to strength.

Why am I falling? And in what circumstances would it benefit me to train a particular type of strength?

Fingers are a common culprit (and a general truth), but also mistakenly prescribed and glorified. Stronger fingers will nearly always help, but improving body technique or addressing a weakness in posterior chain will often quickly and drastically outstrip training fingers.

Our body is much stronger than our fingers. And if I can be more efficient in using my body to unweight my fingers (say even by 1%), that gain is far larger and far more meaningful than chasing the equivalent on the fingerboard.

Still, fingers are the top priority to train. As though they grow in strength the slowest, they are also the most universally applicable and the closest thing to a silver bullet in climbing. \
The right approach is long-term - to consistently and always train, but to place little self-worth and expectation on them.

So how do we train fingers?

One typically can just train fingers on the wall. As long as you get enough stimulus (and less is nearly always better than more), your tendons, pulleys, and joints will adapt over time. \
It's the safer default: to just climb.

The other popular approach (and more closely associated with the term "training") is to hangboard. \
The revered piece of chiseled wood.

Again (as much of this essay will repeat and beat into you!), it's best to ask the question why? \
Why hangboard over climbing?

There are valid reasons and these reasons are also largely personal. Here are mine:

1. My hangboard routine specifically targets weaker grip types I do not usually
   use while climbing (4 fingers open, 3 fingers drag). If I climb (and nearly
   always when I try hard), I will default to using a full or closed crimp when
   I can. By training weaker grip types, I am able to better utilize more holds
   (e.g, use more friction on open handed holds) and preserve my strength for
   when I need to.
2. Hangboarding serves as a consistent and objective measure of strength,
   especially while warming up, as a clear indicator of my body's state of
   recovery. It gives the opportunity to change my session (or abandon it
   entirely!) if I notice I am weaker than I typically am / should be.
3. By hangboarding weaker grip types (and also intentionally not progressing
   stronger grip types until weaker ones catch up), I've noticed improvements in
   health of my fingers in general. Stronger lumbricals, less swollen PIP
   joints, and faster recovery.
4. I like hangboarding! (and drinking coffee and reading poems in between sets as my morning routine)

This thought exercise is quite useful for analyzing anything in a training plan.

What's here and why is it here? \
Can I remove it? Can I just climb instead?

<br>

Besides fingers, what else should I train?

There's some idealized body image of the best climber to be 90% upper body, with the largest forearms genetically possible and the lightest legs possible as well. \
I heard one particularly funny and concerning quote from Mani the Monkey saying that a mark of good climbing genetics is whether your forearms' circumference is larger than your shins. \
I don't think he understands how large shins are (or perhaps I don't understand what kind of climbers he's around).

Regardless, the answer goes back again to "why you train" and what you're training for.

Pull strength is typically another safe answer - but only one especially relevant if you find yourself lacking the power to generate from one hold to another. \
I don't think there's really any point in doing a one arm pull-up (sorry).

One answer I've realized recently actually is legs: hamstrings specfically. \
The climbs I tend to gravitate outdoors (and much outdoor bouldering in general) involve heel hooks and hard ones. Ones where you really need to engage the hamstring and push it to its limit.

That's a rather dangerous maneuver, as it turns out, our hamstrings cannot in fact support the entirety of our bodyweight (as proved by exercises like the nordic curl). Which led me to getting my hamstring injury and then subsequently incorporating hamstring exercises into my routine.

So again, be self critical in the context of your goals. That being said, one general piece of advice follows.

<br>

Focus on rehab and the health of your body above all.

Much (if not all) the exercises I do in my routine are a direct result of injury, which expose certain parts of weaknesses to train. As it turns out, most of my body is pretty weak and tweaky: wrists, shoulders, elbows, hamstrings, lumbricals, PIP joints, knees. \
And if I climb as much as I want to whenever I'd like - I usually find myself hurting in one or more of the regions.

Preventing injury is a conscious and continual effort.

Before each climb you get on, each exercise you commit to doing. Ask yourself - what is the risk of this climb? \
Even (and I'd argue _especially_) when you are uninjured and healthy.

Does it concern a nasty far gaston? Is it a pocket climb? A small crimp climb? A super extended toe?

I've really only started to learn this ability after being injured in pretty much all of those areas. \
It's much harder to distinguish what injury feels like vs fatigue for an unknown area.

This advice is probably the hardest to internalize as a climber, but I'll say it anyways. \
"Less is more, and rest is good."

We also mistakenly think of injuries as acute when the majority usually aren't. Outside the traumatic, most injuries are a symptom of chronic overuse. \
It wasn't that "one climb" that hurt you - it's the months of overtraining that did.

Finally, understand that risk is relative.

This took me a while to understand. There's much climbing diction and media detailing on the dangers of the "full-crimp". \
I eagerly consumed all that and berated myself (and my friends) to stop full-crimping. And then embarked on the well intentioned but poorly executed idea of "training my weaknesses" which consisted of me tossing myself on exclusively hard pinch and sloper problems.

Two weeks later, a TFCC tear in my right wrist. The left followed a week later. I was oblivious to both and ignored the precept of injury (as always) until I realized I couldn't push myself out of my own office chair.

So for me and my body, it turns out, that full-crimping is actually _less_ dangerous for my fingers than climbing open-handed! \
A revelation that took me a while to fully verify.

That isn't to say crimping is without risk, my fingers will still easily ache and swell if I abuse them, but for me its typically lower risk than any powerful slopy climb.

So try and understand your own body - and ask yourself: \
"If I were to be injured, where would it be?" \
"What has the highest chance of breaking in my body right now?"

Right now, I'm dealing with some naggling new sort of wrist injury in my left thumb, De Quervain's tenosynovitis most likely, but seemingly quite mild and residing. \
I'm paying very close attention to my body's ability to recover as I am in a phase where I'm intentionally increasing overall climbing load and training load. \
So I'm intentionally carrying some fatigue from session to session (and accepting that I will be weaker for a period of months) in hopes of triggering more muscular adaptations by training more and eating more. \
So far, it seems like my ability to recover is outpacing what I thought. But I will slowly increase volume over a period of weeks.

<br>

"Work your weaknesses"

Commonly prescribed, but also to be taken with a grain of salt.

For one, what if you don't care to improve on your weaknesses. \
For me, given that all of my goals are outdoors (and likely will be for the majority of my climbing life), does it do me any good to work on indoor dynos or comp style movements? \
Probably not.

It is, however, incomparably useful to work on your weaknesses _if_ they align with your goals and why you climb.

I tended to avoid heel hooks for quite some time. I generally sport quite good hip flexibility and matched with a small frame + soft shoes, I got by putting toes on whatever high feet I could find. \
This worked quite well in the gym (where most feet are large and positive), but proved to be my weakness outdoors. As exposed by the Polish, a techy sustained climb that involves engaging a heel on a slopy rail.

In hindsight, I pretty much had no idea how to heel hook at all when I tried the climb. And disliked it for the longest time because of it.

It took a certain amount of humility and acceptance of failure to really understand the movement and isolate it. I ended up going to the gym and doing nothing but practicing heel hooks (right heel hooks to be specific, the left leg is still catching up), on a myriad of holds.

That unlocked not only the Polish but a whole host of outdoor climbs. Now I delight and gain confidence when I see a heel vs dreading it.

Similarly, the weaknesses I'd like to work on this year are those that I believe will help me climb what I like. These are:
1. Moving slower. My ability to latch a hold and engage it outstrips my ability to endure and hold it. That serves me well and also explains my fast tempo of climbing. I'd like to focus on moving slower on better holds to regain composure and preserve strength.
2. Thuggery. A term I picked up in some guidebook referring to big, slopy, powerful compression esque problems. My body has grown much stronger than it once was in these aspects (e.g, stabler wrists and shoulders), so I think there's no longer much excuse for me shying away from these problems.
3. Trickery. A term I like using to refer to the techy and tricky parts of climbing. Heels, toes, smears, scums and all the weird parts in between. I wouldn't classify this as a weakness, but rather a discipline I enjoy and would continue to like exploring and learning.


<br>
<br>

There's a psychological aspect to training which is often neglected.
And a large part, perhaps the biggest, of why people dread training. 

It's the fact that training revolves around confronting your weaknesses.

The gym bro (who likely places far too much of his self-worth on moonboard benchmarks) will have to step away from the board and stretch. \
The techy outdoor climber (who delights nothing more in finding microbeta) will have to embrace falling on a board V3.

Furthermore, training is often intentional in adding fatigue and targeting muscular adaptations. \
Simply said, this means climbing more and training more, which leads to being unable to climb your hardest every session.

You will not be sending your V Max grade anytime soon - for a period of months if not longer.

People don't like doing that and would rather gravitate to their strengths. \
Which again, is fine, and part of the reason to consider why train at all.

Consider your weaknesses and how they tie into your strengths. Don't force yourself to do what you dislike - nothing is more counterproductive.

But also be brave and be willing to confront, accept, and overcome weakness.

<br>


People like to over-generalize and classify types of climbing.

Are you a dynamic climber? A static climber? A short climber? A tall climber?

The truth isn't so simple. And my climbing style is more than just "dynamic and short." \
It serves as a useful exercise to think deeply and specifically about your own style, your strengths and weaknesses, and your body.

I've been thinking a little about crimp these days. \
As mentioned above, I'm strongest closed crimp, and probably always will be. Part of the reason why is the way my fingers are. I have relatively long pinkies (close to my index). But even more important, I have somewhat long thumbs and the wrist mobility to often put my thumb right next to my index finger on a hold. \
So more specifically, I don't actually full crimp that often (and my index fingers are grateful for it), I usually just crimp with five fingers on.

This also means I'm relatively weak on an edge compared to my peers. My hangboard numbers are not great, another personal reason I like hangboarding - as it prevents me from doing my normal five finger trickery. \
I'm also much stronger on smaller edges (relative) than larger edges with added weight. \
And, as mentioned before, I can latch a hold quite quickly but be unable to endure very long on it.

Other "crimp climbers" are very different too - and it shows in how they position themselves on a climb. \
What feet they use, whether they prefer to flag or climb square, even if they prefer the exact same grip type I do.

Developing this understanding of your body and your style helps inform your own strengths and weaknesses. \
For me that's manifesting in training endurance and moving slower on the wall.

One idea I'm pretty keen on exploring is this idea of "small holds body tension."

A phrase Aidan Roberts talks about a lot about: the ability to generate force away from the wall with hands, which enables your feet to push against. \
So rather than climbing with hips in and positioning yourself under holds, it's this style of climbing that's very tic-tacy and about counterforce. \
Another unique ability to the full crimp - where the range of motion it unlocks is much larger than open-handed holds and it's possible to pull away from the wall.

Maybe a way to explain it is that he more or less treats crimps like jugs (tiny little "jugs" with an in-cut) and that unlocks new possibilities for body tension.

Pretty neat to think about and another style I'm planning to explore.

<br>

The mental aspects are next.

One general mantra that's helped me is approaching each climb as an opportunity to learn. 

That doesn't mean you shouldn't try hard (you should try to send climbs!), but it again means being intentional.

What am I trying to practice, what am I trying to learn from this climb? \
If its my style and a comfortable grade, I will try hard to flash the climb. And practice routereading, tactics, and execution. \
If its my style and my project grade, I will try hard to learn, rehearse, and execute the climb quickly. An exercise in session tactics, mindset, and trying hard. \
If its not my style, I will isolate on the movements I want to learn from the climb (focus on open-handing this hold or generating from an uncomfortable foot).

So sending often still is the goal - its a testament to ability and the fact that you've learned the lessons the climb presents. \
But it isn't the focus or the "why" of a particular climb.

A lesson in movement.

<br>

Training does not entitle you success.

You've trained long and hard for the winter seasons and are excited to embark on a climbing trip across the globe in Spring. \
Your hangboard numbers have went up, you've sent archnemesis board climbs, and you're feeling stronger and fitter than ever.

But, much to your dismay, you're finding that you can't translate your gains to the rock. Is it a matter of fitness? Of conditions? Of preparation?

I experienced it this season with Boxcar Arete.

I had quite a summer, where after my rather severe hamstring sprain, I made the decision to quit climbing for two months until I was able to walk freely without pain and rehabilitate myself on the wall. \
So I ended up doing a lot of hangs (a lot).

That got me much stronger (at least in terms of my hangboard numbers) than before, but wasn't able to actually translate that onto the wall for a little while. \
I was quite self-aware of the funny state I was in and was able to reteach my body how to use my legs (and get over the fear of toeing in hard) in a few weeks indoors.

But I didn't project anything hard. I did send a few climbs, but nothing that took longer than a few sessions.

When I went to try boxcar, I was unprepared. Physically I was fitter than I ever was and was able to do most of the individual moves on the climb in a few attempts. \
A drastic improvement from April, where I wasn't able to do a single move on the climb (which I realize now was _not_ the crux but rather one of the easier moves).

I did all the moves a session later and sent the stand start. \
I went out two more times afterwards, giving send burns from the bottom and got close a few times - but punted each attempt.

Strength wasn't the reason I failed to send boxcar. It was nerves. \
I wasn't used to trying hard and forgot how to. Forgot the preparation, routines, and headspace needed.

It's a hard, difficult, exhausting state to be in. To give it everything. \
To sit there looking at the rock with expectations pounding in your ears. \
To ignore it all and focus purely and solely on the climb.

This was what I needed to learn and practice. \
And the only way to do it, is to project something hard.

A similar learning applies to flashing and doing climbs quickly. \
If that's your goal, you should incorporate that same exercise into your training.

Treat it holistically: brush all the holds, incorporate and experiment with tactics, and put yourself in that try hard mode.

<br>

Tactics.

One very nerdy aspect of climbing I think I'm quite good at. \
Or rather, I enjoy it heavily so.

Some random things:
1. Brush all the holds. Feel all the holds that you can. Especially on flash
   burns, it's difficult to know how each hold will feel, so resorting to
   assuming that they are bad (or moving to each hold overly controlled) is a
   common tactic. But you do need to place some bets based off the knowledge you
   have: if a hold looks good, trust it and climb with that knowledge.
2. Look from below. I find it very helpful to visualize movement by standing
   directly under a boulder and looking at the holds from below. Hug the boulder
   a bit and think of doing the move from the position you'll see it. It makes
   things more concrete and more real - and you'll be less likely to panic when
   giving attempts.
3. Take your shoes off and play with them on the rock. By the wizard Dave
   Graham. Feel the footholds, take your shoe and place it, mess around
   with the orientation, apply pressure and imagine the best way to leverage
   your feet. 
4. Eat many many snacks. Carbs and coffee are crazy send fuel. Do be a little
   conservative as to not induce any gastric distress, but sweets can do
   immeasurable things for performance (and happiness).
5. Rest a little longer than you think. Always. Even though you may feel quite
   recovered, a few minutes more will nearly always benefit.
6. Air out skin after chalking. More specific for my sweaty fingers, but I find
   my skin can sweat after immediately chalking (as a byproduct of rubbing my
   hands against each other). Air them out after chalking.
7. Pre-tape for sharp climbs. On climbs you expect to take skin, but don't
   expect to flash, it's useful to pre-tape to save skin while learning 
   or rehearsing movement.
8. Optimize the conditions you can - and accept what you can't. Weather is
   fickle and so is the rock. Do what you can to condition (e.g, eat well the
   night before, try and order your climbs by difficulty), but also don't
   stress the details. Trust in your training and your climbing.
9. Rest your mind. I find that sometimes obsessing over a climb and 
   letting your mind hyper fixate on the climb can be counterproductive. 
   And by the time I'm done resting, I find myself less able to focus and try
   hard. Take your time and follow the stoke.
10. Warm up specifically. If your project involves a hard right gaston, it is
    worth deviating from what you usually do and to
    attempt to simulate the movement and stress. Similarly, if your project is a
    small crimp menace, warming up open handed on larger edges is likely
    unsuited.

There's more that I'm thinking of (but don't want to be too verbose, and ten is
a pretty number). And more that I'm likely forgetting. But hopefully, some of them stand to be useful. 

<br>

This was much longer than I expected. Thank you for listening to me ramble and apologies if it sounded preachy or presumptuous.

These are my thoughts on training as of now. I'm certain some parts will change in the future and I also look forward to re-reading this post then.

It is a gumby's take on training, not anyone of repute, so please take it lightly and humorously.

<br>

Hope you enjoyed.
