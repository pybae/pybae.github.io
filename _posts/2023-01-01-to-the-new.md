Another new year, another new me.

I quite like the idea of new year’s resolutions. \
I find a certain fun in goal setting and enjoy doing so at some regular cadence. 

So I’ve done so. My goals for the last were as follows: 

1. Climb V10
2. Start a business
3. Be a better friend

An amusing medley. Needless to say, failure was the majority outcome.

I don’t lament the fact. Nor do I feel shame in my past self. \
I tried. And though I didn’t achieve what I set out to, I learned from the matter.

<br>

And so, once again, I’m here to do the same.

1. Continue

That is this year’s goal.

To do nothing different. \
To do exactly what I have been doing. \
To continue.

<br>

I crave change. To stay still: nothing is more terrifying.

A disease really. \
A senseless compulsive desire for the new and to mistake that for growth.

I fear stagnation. \
I fear the end, that life will continue on in cyclic perpetuity.

So I toil. \
Be that through routine, systems of restraint and repetition designed for an outcome, or through whim and the immediate gratification it provides. \
Something, anything, to distract me and convince me that I’m changing: that life has more.

<br>

This year too, I will continue.

To pursue my passions, cherish my relationships, and be my self. \
To continue all the same.

Where that ends, who knows. \
Let’s see next year.
