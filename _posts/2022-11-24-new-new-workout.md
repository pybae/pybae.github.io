title: the new new workout plan
---
This note is a bit of an essay and bit of a plan. \
The new new workout plan.

It is almost entirely about climbing. \
A reflection on the year and journey thus far and a stab at charting what’s next. 

<br>

2022 was odd.

I got a lot stronger. Almost undeservedly so. \
I learned a few things. How to climb and why. \
I set some goals. Didn’t manage to do most. \
But am still quite happy nonetheless.

A few things changed.


<br>

I climbed less. Not more. \
And that led me to be quite a bit stronger.

I began to understand how to train. How to train properly. \
What load, what intensity. \
What exercises, what climbs. \
When to do them.

Funny how by caring less and trying less, I got stronger. \
A stark contrast to a year ago where I’d be literally breaking myself training.

<br>


I learned to love climbing.

A big part of that was the outdoors. \
A few trips to the Gunks and a group trip to Red Rock.

Simply being out, doing what I love with the people I love. \
Nothing beats that.

The gumby gang philosophy. \
You can’t always be strong and the conditions aren’t always good. \
But you can always have fun. Always.


<br>

I worked on my weaknesses and figured out my strengths.

I have no aspirations of being a well-rounded climber. \
I quite like having a distinct style and relishing in that.

Yet, there is no excuse for ignoring what is difficult just because it is uncomfortable. \
And by addressing that - I ended up turning a weakness into a strength.


<br>

I lost weight. A bit too much.

This year was the first I tried to intentionally manipulate my body with the focus on climbing.

More specifically, I tried to be in the “best shape of my life” prior to Red Rock. \
I did that by losing 15 pounds in three months.

It worked. I was strong, light, weightless. \
It worked too well.

Some sort of body dysmorphia and eating disorder came soon afterwards. \
Not to an extreme extent - I was lucky to be quite experienced with dieting and had a systemic approach.

Yet, I still weighed myself every morning. \
Happy when the numbers dropped and sad when they didn’t.


<br>

I tried a few projects. \
Relearned how to project. And how much I enjoy it.

I sent one: the polish. But wasn’t so happy afterwards. \
I got too strong for the climb - and though I still needed to climb well to do it, it didn’t demand much of me.

I failed on a few others. Was quite happy afterwards. \
I tried hard and was happy that I could.

I was reminded of what projecting is. \
To try something you might not be able to. \
To confront yourself and your limit. \
To pull on and to embrace fear, weakness, expectation. \
To give it everything.

It’s these moments I crave.

I’m still not very good at it. \
I’d like to be.

Climbing is a mental game. \
We train our bodies to do ridiculous feats of strength, but we rarely train our fortitudes.

<br>


Onto 2023.

Mid way through 2022, I made a “ticks” list. \
Goals I wanted to achieve by the end of the year.

Some were more akin to good habits to keep in mind: rehab injuries and prevent future ones. \
Others were a lot more concrete: hang 22mm, send the aforementioned projects, go on more climbing trips.

Having these goals worked. \
Despite the fact that I failed at most, they served as a source of inspiration and motivation. \
Made things a lot clearer - what I was training for and how to achieve them.

There is a danger in setting goals.

Goals are powerful. \
They deliberately warp your focus and self-worth around them. Especially for me. \
So setting “good goals” becomes even more important.

There’s a multitude of approaches on setting goals and even more axes on how to evaluate them. \
Achievability, practicality, trackability, specificity, e.g.

In the end though, I think the only thing that matters is how much I want it. \
How much does this “thing” inspire me. Regardless of how hard, how achievable, how practical it is.

So, what do I want to do? In 2023 and onwards.

<br>


I’d like to climb well.

Climbing is tantalizing in that it’s often possible to do single moves and links on a project. But frustratingly difficult to do the problem itself.
Some amount of trepidation, fatigue and pressure makes it difficult to climb well. To climb well under duress: both physical and mental.

I have a rather strong ego that if I can do all the individual moves, I can link them together. \
Well, I’d like to prove that to myself. And be able to do that quickly.

I don’t see much point or fun in tossing myself endlessly on a project. \
Sure, that is in fact how you send. And I probably could’ve done just that to send some climbs this year.

Maybe that’s not so necessary though. \
Maybe it’s possible to climb well, so well, that you can climb at your limit on demand. \
And that spending additional time, effort and obsession on a project is purely redundant.

A pipe dream, but one that I’m motivated to pursue.

<br>


I’d like to get stronger still.

Strength is weird to think about. One can always be stronger. \
But focusing solely on strength can lead to a pit of obsession and reduction.

The thought creeps - “I’m not strong enough.” \
And one slowly finds their self worth gravitating to how “strong” they perceive themselves to be, most often in relation to their peers.

I’m weak. And I like being weak. 

I won’t ever be “strong.” \
No matter how I train or how I try.  \
It took a while to learn that lesson.

Still, I’d like to get stronger. \
A matter of practicality now.

To try the climbs I’d like, I need to get stronger. \
To climb more and to be injury free, I need to get stronger.

That’s it.

<br>


I’d like to climb more.

Climbing hard is what inspires me. Always has been. \
Was more about the grade before and showing that to others. \
It’s more personal now. I want to try hard and climbing’s a way to explore that.

But, that’s not all there is to climbing. \
There is a real spiritual element to it.

I saw a bit of it when I had my panic attack leading a 5.10 at Rumney.

That climbing can be a means to confront fear and insecurity. \
That climbing isn’t just a means to self-satisfaction and contrived purpose. More than an escapist hobby for the able-bodied bourgeois. \
But an avenue for personal growth and exploration.

I’d like to explore more of that. Try new things and push myself. \
Even now, I’m scared of leading. To very directly confront my fears and trauma.

But I would learn from it. So let's try it.

And to also just climb more different types of climbing I might’ve shied away from before. \
Self-selecting the climbs I like pigeon holes me into not considering others.

I’d like to try everything. Climb everything and learn from each experience.
