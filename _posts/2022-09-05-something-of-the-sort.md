title: something of the sort

I told a friend that I was thinking of starting a blog. Rare of me.

I don’t usually voice my intention to do anything - be that a hobby or a goal - to others. I dislike the “showing” part of it: that you do what you do because you say (or really want to say) that you’re doing it.


“Yeah, I read, I’ve been reading the Alchemist this last week, so insightful. Do you read?” \
“I try and practice mindfulness a few times a week - to center myself and stay grounded.”


A gross coagulation of undirected thoughtless self-help and improvement hobbies.

Things guys would brag about doing on Hinge. \
Things they do to “work on themselves.”

Maybe that’s a bit too pessimistic. \
Ironic too, given that I do just about everything prescribed.

I meditate. \
I wake up early, I sleep early. \
I cook, I clean. \
I read. \
And I write.

But none of these things are inherently good or productive, whatever that means. They don’t make me a better person and certainly don’t give me any right to judge others based off them.

I meditate as a habit, one I picked up as a way to cope as a stressed out pubescent teen. \
I wake up early since I’m an insomniac, who can’t sleep in more than six hours even if I try. \
I cook because I like it, and clean because I have to. \
I read, not so often frankly, but only when I want to. \
And I write, well, because I need to.

The thought of self-improvement irks me. 

And even more so when people use it to claim some vague moral high ground. \
The fact that they think their Peloton streak, meal-prepped meals, and Goodreads checklist makes them better. \
That their viceless lives are healthier and are worth more than others.

They’d never admit to that, but probably would silently judge you for drinking that beer or smoking that joint.

Fuck that.

You don’t need to “improve yourself.” You don’t need to change. \
Nothing’s wrong with trying to, but that doesn’t make it right either.

Everybody has their vices. But what even is a vice?
Is drinking so bad? Is there anything really that wrong with smoking, with drugs, with hooking up?

There isn’t. \
There is no unilateral good and there is no unilateral bad. \
It’s all up to you, and there should be no societal pressure, no imposition on that.

<br>

I got off-topic.

But that’s probably what this blog, if it exists, is. \
A collection of thoughts, unfiltered opinions, stories and past experiences. \
Disorganized, sporadic, poorly written and a little incoherent, but unashamedly honest.

Something of the sort.
